# Open-Now

OpenNow is a platform for community members in the Charlottesville and Albemarle County area - including University of Virginia students, faculty, and staff - to explore local small businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Users can view businesses, submit reviews for businesses, crowdsource their business hours, and submit their own business entries to OpenNow. Additionally, users can connect with other community members and share their experiences via the OpenNow forums. OpenNow is largely a crowdsourcing experiment to benefit the businesses that contribute so much to the Charlottesville area.

This project was created for the course CS 3240 in the Spring semester of 2021 with a team of 5 undergraduate students at the University of Virginia. To view an online demo of this application, visit a deployed version of the application on [Heroku](https://open-now.herokuapp.com/)
